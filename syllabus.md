# ECE-573 Data Structures and Algorithms

* 2024 Spring
* **Instructor:**  [Dov Kruger](https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/Dov-Kruger)
* **[Meeting Times and Office hours](https://bit.ly/3Ql9mpl)**
* **[Resources](ref)**
* **[Course Web Address](https://github.com/RU-ECE/ECE573-DB)**

**Prerequisites** 		
This course requires a good command of C++.
You will have to write algorithms and debug them.

## COURSE DESCRIPTION

Applied Data Structures and algorithms is an intensive introduction to brilliant solutions to classical problems with wide application across computer programming.  Using great solutions and approaches you can write programs that are far faster and more efficient. We cover:

* Families of optimal approaches to solve problems (like divide and conquer)
* Use dynamic programming to avoid redundant computation
* Week 1: Analysis of algorithms (complexity)
* Week 2: Dynamic arrays
* Week 3: Linked lists, Stacks and Queues
* Week 4: Trees: binary, RB Tree, BTree, Trie
* Week 5: Hashing
* Week 6: Sorting (Insertion, Quicksort, Heapsort, Mergesort)
* Week 7: Searching (binary, golden mean)
* midterm
* Week 9: String algorithms including Boyer-Moore, finite state machines and LCS
* Week 10: Matrix algorithms
* Week 11: Backtracking to search a large set of solutions
* Week 12: Introduction to Graph Theory (DFS, BFS, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshal, Prim, Kruskal, TSP)
* Week 13: Number-theoretic problems
  * Primality testing, Eratosthenesâ€™ sieve, Prime number wheel
* Compute Fermat and Miller-Rabin probabilistic prime number algorithms, learn about AKS
* Identify the theoretical and practical weaknesses in RSA encryption
* Numerical algorithms: root finding, interpolation, integration

## Course Outcomes

After successful completion of this course, students will be able to
*  Analyze programs and algorithms and determine the complexity of the code
*  Identify the best possible performance based on limits to algorithmic efficiency
*  Write, debug, and test data structures
*  Apply the best data structure or algorithm for a particular purpose
*  Recognize and apply common approaches to high-performance such as divide-and-conquer
*  Independently research new algorithms based on knowledge of the fundamentals
*  Gain familiarity with other areas of computer algorithms for future growth and learning
  * Analyze code to determine its complexity and determine whether it can be optimized
  * Implement algorithms in C++ or Java
  * Choose from a set of algorithms and select the most appropriate
  * Work together in teams to solve problems
