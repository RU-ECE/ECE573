1. Search yourself using scholar
   scholar: your search terms
   1. Figure out keywords that define your search
   2. Record your search ideas
   3. Get help from the Librarian
   4. If you hit a paywall, ask a librarian OR
       search for title + pdf
   5. Download pdfs to a ref folder
2. Search using the library's Database
   1. IEEE is best for hardcore EE
   2. for CS, ACM is on par with IEEE
3. Prefer papers that are either
   1. Highly cited
   2. Have relevant titles
   3. Are survey papers that summarize the topic. Survey papers can be substantially easier to read and may have a particularly good list of citations covering the area.
4. You do not have to read all the papers. First skim them and see if they are relevant. Once you find papers that seem relevant, read 2-3 of those.
   1. You are also encouraged to find code!
   2. Make it your own. DO NOT USE OTHER PEOPLE's CODE WITHOUT COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING.
5. Meet with the librarian to help improve your search. The librarian can:
   1. Suggest ways of filtering your search
   2. Suggest better keywords or alternatives
6. Upload all the papers you read into the ref directory of your repo. You may optionally create a directory under ref called other and put all the other papers you found that weren't relevant in there.
7. Write all the citations in refs.bib in overleaf.
8. Setup the skeleton of your overleaf using the example given.
   1. Here are two examples of high quality papers in correct format: [Final_report1.pdf]()Final_report1.pdf [Final_report2.pdf]()Final_report2.pdf 
   2. An example of the source code in overleaf will be provided soon: TODO: overleaf URL.
